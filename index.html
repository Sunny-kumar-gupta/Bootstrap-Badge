        <p>Covid-19 Molnupiravir benefits outweight risks, say top medical experts.
             The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid 
             particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe.
              These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.
            You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are near someone who has
             COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes,
              nose or mouth. The virus spreads more easily indoors and in crowded settings.</p>

COVID-19 has disrupted the environments in which children grow and develop. These disruptions to families, friendships, daily routines and the wider community can have negative consequences for children’s well-being, development and protection.

In addition, <span class="mark">measures used to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 </span>can expose children to protection risks.

There are also indications that domestic violence is on the increase.
